<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Duygu Bulut. I'm a beginner web developer with a strong passion for learning and growing in the world of software development. I truly enjoy discovering new things and sharing the knowledge I gain along the way.
My professional background is in import and export operations, where I currently work as an operations specialist. However, my interest in software led me to start developing my skills in web development. This website was originally created as part of a course project, but I wanted to use this space to share a bit more about myself and my learning journey.
Over time, I plan to update this site with more content about what Iâ€™m learning and building.
